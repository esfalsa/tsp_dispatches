[title]Get involved in the South Pacific[/title]

[p]The South Pacific is a very big and diverse region, there are a lot of activities you can participate in here, ranging from just fun banter to serious politics. Below are ways that you can become more involved in the community and have fun in the process![/p]

[h1]Interact with others[/h1]

[p]You can get involved in our region just by chatting with your fellow nations on:[/p]

[list]
[*][url=rmb][b]The Regional Message Board (RMB)[/b][/url]: This is the on-site message board of our region. Most conversations on there are fun and silly banter! Remember to read the [url=rmb_rules]RMB Rules and Etiquette[/url] first to make sure you don't get in trouble with the moderators.
[*][url=discord][b]Discord[/b][/url]: For more diverse conversations, you should have a look at our Discord server. This is the place where talks about real-life, memes, bot games, and most government discussions happen. If you want to get involved in the government then joining our Discord server is a must.
[*][url=forum][b]Forum[/b][/url]: We have a forum where more formal conversations happen. Formal business of the government such as elections, legislative and judicial proceedings, alongside serious roleplays with plot happen on there. Although it is a place for slow and well thought-out talks, we still have [url=f_spam]spam games[/url] to keep you entertained!
[/list]

[h1]Participate in the World Assembly and get endorsements[/h1]

[p][url=ns_wa]The World Assembly[/url] is the United Nations of NationStates. It passes resolutions that affect all member nations in many areas. If you want your nation to have a voice on the international stage and would like to feel what is it like to engage in international politics, you should join the World Assembly! Joining the WA not only allows you to vote on resolutions that impact your nation but also enables you to give and gain a very important thing called [i]endorsements[/i]. Endorsements give your nation [i]influence[/i] which improves your standing internationally and is critical to our region's security.[/p]

[p]We have a program called the [url=swan_intro]Southern World Assembly Initiative[/url]. It will enable and incentivize your nation to gather more endorsements and influence which in turn give our region as a whole more power on the WA and more security.[/p]

[h1]Help the region vote on WA resolutions[/h1]

[p]Aside from voting on WA resolutions yourself, our region has a program run by the [url=f_owl_join]Office of WA Legislation[/url] that allows you to influence how others will vote too! There is a place known as [region]the South Pacific WA Voting Center[/region] where you can help the Delegate and regional nations decide on the next WA resolutions to hit the floor. Before a WA resolution hits the floor, that region will conduct a vote and debate on its RMB about the resolution. You can cast your vote and show your reasons to others on how the Delegate should vote and what regional nations are recommended to do on the resolution.[/p]

[h1]Roleplay (RP)[/h1]

[p]Roleplay is a way for you to surpass the limitations the game placed upon your creativity by writing stories. You can write about wars, trading, relations,... with other nations and write news or history about your own nation. There are many ways you can roleplay in our region:[/p]

[list]
[*][region]Knowhere[/region]: This is a region where you can post informal roleplays (e.g. news about your nation) on the Message Board. You don't need to move your nation to this region in order to post on its RMB.
[*][url=f_main_canon][b]Main Canon[/b][/url]: This is an area on our forum where canon roleplays which take place on [url=f_main_canon_map]our map[/url] happen. You can have serious roleplays about wars, trades, meetings, news,... here. Most roleplays on here are very long with complex world-building so if you like to write long stories, this may be the place for you.
[*][url=f_extra_canon][b]Extra Canon (Forum)[/b][/url]: For non-canon roleplay where we don't stick to the map.
[/list]

[p]Always remember to read the rules and guides of any roleplay community you participate in to avoid getting lost.[/p]

[h1]Let's your voice heard by joining the Assembly[/h1]

[p][url=f_become_legislator][b]Click here to join[/b][/url][/p]

[p]If you want to have a say in the laws and decisions of the region and its leaders or you just want to get a hand in politics, sign up to be a legislator! Legislators are members of [url=assembly_intro]the Assembly[/url], our legislature. They create, debate, and vote on laws and decisions which govern the region. You can become a legislator by simply signing up [url=f_become_legislator]here[/url]. There are no requirements to join, except that you are a resident in good faith.[/p]

[h1]Work in the executive branch of the government[/h1]

[p][url=f_government_jobs][b]Click here to join[/b][/url][/p]

[p]Another way to participate in the government is to join the executive branch. The South Pacific is a big region which requires numerous people with different skills to effectively operate it. Therefore, there are lots of positions in the government that you can take! The government needs ambassadors to represent us in other regions, soldiers and officers for its military [url=spsf_signup]the South Pacific Special Forces[/url], event organizers to make fun events, writers and journalists for [url=media_services]public media[/url], managers to manage our projects, and more.[/p]

[p]All executive positions only require you to sign up via an application and you [u]do not need any experience at all[/u] to join! For more information on what executive positions are available and how to sign up for them, please visit [url=f_government_jobs]this forum post[/url].[/p]

[p]If you ever want to run for an office in the executive branch (e.g. a minister) in the future, having a position in the government is the [i]best[/i] way to gain experience for the office you want to hold. You will be able to collect valuable experience and establish relationships with other people which will help you get the votes.[/p]

[h1]More ways![/h1]

[p]There is nearly no limit on what you can do in our region. You can create [url=f_spam]games[/url], [url=f_media]newspapers, discussions[/url], [url=f_org]organizations, political parties[/url],... in our region on the gameside or the forum. It is up to you to choose what ways to have the most fun in our community![/p]

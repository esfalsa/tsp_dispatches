[title]Proscriptions[/title]
[subtitle]in the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

[p]A Proscription is a ban on one individual or an entire region or organization from staying and participating in any area under the jurisdiction of the Coalition of the South Pacific's Government. Such harsh punishments are only carried out to individuals or organizations that have committed very serious offenses to the Coalition as a whole (coup d'etat, invasion, infiltration, etc.). Proscriptions are issued and revoked by [url=cabinet_intro]the Cabinet[/url] or [url=crs_intro]the Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS). Proscriptions can be reviewed by [url=court_intro]the High Court[/url] or by the issuing authority (Cabinet and/or CRS) under request from [url=assembly_intro]the Assembly[/url].[/p]
